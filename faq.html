				<li><strong>What are Widescreen Weddings?</strong></li>
					<p>The Widescreen wedding coverage is the greatest thing to happen to weddings since the garter ceremony.  Our acquisition of the latest HDV widescreen cameras enable us to shoot your special day in all it's cinematic glory.  Like the movies you watch,  your video is panoramic (16:9).  It will take advantage of the Plasma or LCD screen you're asking your parents to give you on your wedding day.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>What is the onsite MTV and exactly what's the big deal about it?</strong></li>
					<p>The onsite MTV is a type of AVP wherein we edit the shots we took during the preparation and ceremony into a one-song music video.
					<p>For the past years that we've been doing this, reactions have all been great. There's a certain wonder in the guests' eyes as they watch what transpired earlier on. The couple gets a breather and actually gets a sense of what happened and a new awareness of their special day.
					<p>It's great for after-wedding parties because you get it immediately (ideal for balikbayans) and quells the thirst for the final editied version which won't be due for some months. It's also ideal for weddings where you don't expect a lot of people to attend the ceremony.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>What's the big deal about 3ccds cams?</strong></li>
					<p>Really no big deal... except they cost a gazillion bucks more than your ordinary, run-of-the-mill handycam. Seriously, CCD means charge coupled device. This is the part of the camera in charge of converting light into electric signals. 3CCD cams separate the light into distinct RED, GREEN, BLUE channels. This results is a finer picture and more brilliant colors. Ordinary digicams only have ONE ccd.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>Is the edited video stricty 30 mins?</strong></li>
					<p>Nope. It's just an approximate. But the length of the wedding video is greatly dependent on what happens in the actual wedding day.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>You are more expensive relative to most videographers. Why?</strong></li>
					<p>Let's just put it this way. The rate we give out is our perceived value of our work. We are very proud and have high regard for what we do, we continullay invest in equipment and technology that will make the videos better. We make sure that every client is more than satisfied and happy with our work. We make it a point to prove that we are worth every centavo paid to us.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>I'm concerned with the lighting at the ceremony. How do you go about that?</strong></li>
					<p>Don't worry. We strike a very fine balance between illuminating the venue properly and not calling attention to ourselves . Our lights are neatly secured on stands strategically placed in key areas of the venue. Rest assured, no blinding and roasting of the guests will occur.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>Is it all "MTV style?"</strong></li>
					<p>No. We go MTV during the bridal prep and other portions of the weding where the original audio is non-essential. But rest assured, we give due screen time for the homily, vows, speeches and toasts.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>Who picks the music?</strong></li>
					<p>You do. But more often that not couples give me the free hand in deciding. Of course I choose the music based on your personalities. If I see the groom with a big crossbones tatoo on his nape, I'm not about to put Britney on the video.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>Is the person I'm going to marry truly the person for me?</strong></li>
					<p>I'm really not the person to ask, but if you insist... You know he/she is the right one if you can freely fart a loud squishy one in front of him/her without getting embarrassed.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>Do you accept pencil bookings?</strong></li>
					<p>The trouble with pencil bookings is that lead easily gets erased. Honestly, I've been burned quite a number of times, so the policy now is - no downpayment, no reservation.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>What makes you different from other videographers?</strong></li>
					<p>I call this the beauty pageant question. Of course, when put on the spot, i take a deep breath bat my lashes, smile and say...We take our philosophy in shooting very seriously. We take great lengths to remain as unobtrusive and candid as possible. We pride ourselves with excellent camerawork further enhanced by exceptional editing, and of course...world peace.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>My wedding is not in Manila, is there an additional charge?</strong></li>
					<p>Yes there is, or transportation costs and other expenses incurred. Including the hefty meals my matakaw crew needs. (the rate is variable depending on what we order, i mean the venue of the wedding)
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>Do I have to feed you?</strong></li>
					<p>Not really, But I wish to god you would. Also, hungry videographers don't make good videographers. But hey, we should be the last thing on your mind. Don't worry, I always carry skyflakes and a piece of ham in my wallet.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>Do you have preferences with the photographers you work with?</strong></li>
					<p>As long as they're nice and clean and take daily baths. Check out the links page.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>Why don't you have a package for photos?</strong></li>
					<p>If I did, we'd be called jasonmagbanua Digital Video and Photo but we're not.  I guess to each his own, it's a matter of expertise. I'd actually be wary of photographers who give out video for free or at a ridiculously low price. Remember the age-old saying - you get what you pay for.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>Why does it take so long to edit the video?</strong></li>
					<p>As i mentioned, i am not a wedding video factory. We try to make each video distinct from the rest, nothing generic. This philosophy leads us to long excruciating hours, days and weeks of editing the video. I am not offering any excuses, it's just the way it is. If you're looking for a quick and speedy turnaround, i may not be what you are looking for.
					<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<li><strong>Are you gay?</strong></li>
					<p>I've asked this a lot of times to myself before. But my wife says otherwise. I believe her, I think.
